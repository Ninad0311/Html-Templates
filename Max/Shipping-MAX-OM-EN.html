            <div class="pop-que-inner">
                <p><strong>I placed an order today. When can I expect my shipment?</strong></p>
                <p>Your delivery schedule will depend on the product and the time that you placed your order. Go to the
                    Orders section under My Account or click on the order number in your Order Confirmation email to check
                    on the status of your delivery.</p>   <p><strong>What if I miss a delivery?</strong></p>
                <p>If you are not at home, our delivery partner will call you and request you to reschedule your delivery.
                    Simply call our Customer Support team on 800-MAXUAE (800-629823), and we’ll schedule another delivery
                    date and time that suits you better.</p>   <p><strong>I’ve already paid OMR</strong><strong> 2, so why
                        am I being charged an additional OMR 2?</strong></p>
                <p>These two amounts are for two separate charges. Our standard shipping charge is OMR 2, while our Cash on
                    Delivery charge is OMR 2. If you’re paying by cash, you’ll have to pay an extra OMR 2 over and above our
                    shipping charge. Of course, you can always avoid the Cash on Delivery charge by paying with your Credit
                    or Debit Card.</p>   <p><strong>Can I pick up my order from your warehouse?</strong></p>
                <p>No, but you can pick up your order from our delivery partner’s office if you wish. Simply ask them to
                    hold your order at their office when they contact you before delivery.</p>
