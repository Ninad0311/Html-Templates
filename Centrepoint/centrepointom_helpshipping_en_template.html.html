                    <p>Your delivery schedule will depend on the product and the time that you placed your order. Go to the

                        on the status of your delivery.</p>

        <p><strong>I’ve already paid AED 10, so why am I being charged an additional AED 10?</strong></p>
        
        <p>These two amounts are for two separate charges. Our standard shipping charge is AED 10, while our Cash on Delivery charge is AED 10. If you’re paying by cash, you’ll have to pay an extra AED 10 over and above our shipping charge. Of course, you can always avoid the Cash on Delivery charge by paying with your Credit or Debit Card.</p>
